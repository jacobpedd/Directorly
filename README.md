# Directorly

Direcotly is a project that I worked on at the 24 hour Y Combinator hackathon in April of 2018. 
The goal of the project was to make a service to help manage contacts. The implementation 
was in two facets:

1. Easy download of a complete contact file through QR code
2. Creation of groups so that events can easily share a directory of contacts

The app is implemented in Django and the functionality above is acheived. If the project
were to continue some features I would like to see are:

* Implementation of contact information updates
* Mobile applications to make reading and writing contacts easier
* More features around groups

This project was a great experience to work on, for my first hackathon I was very happy 
with the results!
